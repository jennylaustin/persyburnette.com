Although we never could have dreamed up the nightmare we find ourselves in this
Thanksgiving, we are more grateful than ever. The outpouring of love and
support for Persy and our family is beyond anything we could have imagined.
Your continuous thoughts, prayers, donations, messages of love and acts of
kindness have carried us and given Brittany and Ryan the strength they need to
continue on.

Today was a quieter day for Persy. Our prayers were answered in that his
agitation and swelling were both significantly reduced allowing our sweet boy
to finally rest.  He slept through the night and most of the day. Brittany and
Ryan were comforted by numerous visits as our families gathered with them in
prayer, brought them meals, and showered them with love.

Persy wasn't too fond of the feeding tube in his nose, and he promptly removed
it during the night (our feisty little rebel!). Luckily, he was able to take
his meds orally and actually ate some food (applesauce and apple bars).
Brittany and Ryan received the results of Persy’s MIBG scan which revealed he
is avid and may be a candidate for this type of treatment in the future.
Persy’s heart rate was a little elevated throughout the day, he spiked a fever,
and his oxygen saturation levels were a bit low. They found out this was being
caused by fluid in his lung , which may need to be drained surgically if it
does not resolve with medicine alone.

### Little victories

- Persy had his third chemo treatment and is on his way to a full recovery.
  Even the fluid in his lung did not stop him from getting his next treatment.
- Persy’s swelling continues to decrease which has helped with his agitation
  and discomfort.
- Persy was more himself today and even put the code into his iPad by himself
  for the first time since he’s been sick.
- Persy said “I love you dada” and even played a tiny bit with mama and his
  stuffed animals.
- Best of all, Persy smiled for a selfie with mama and dada to close out the
  day.

### Please pray

- For the fluid to drain from Persy’s lung so he doesn’t have to have it
  surgically removed.
- That the medical team can begin to wean Persy from some of his pain
  medicines.
- For Persy’s swelling to continue to decrease.
- For his body to respond to the chemo and specifically that the chemo
  obliterates all the metastatic cancer sites in his body.
- For his cancer to be attacked by the chemo, but for his precious body to be
  protected from the damage caused by the toxic chemicals.

Gracious Lord, we thank You that You are a merciful God who cares for, loves,
and protects little children and that You hear and answer our prayers. We thank
you for letting us see that we are blessed beyond measure even in difficult
times. Keep our precious lamb, Persy, enfolded in your sheltering arms and
resting in your grace. Bring him back to full health, we pray. We give You
thanks for You are good and Your mercy endures forever. Amen.
