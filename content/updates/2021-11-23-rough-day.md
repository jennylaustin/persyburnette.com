Today was another rough day for our little warrior, Persy. After some triumphs
yesterday, he had a difficult night of restlessness and agitation that
unfortunately continued throughout the day. Our sweet lil love just can’t get
comfortable making it impossible for him to settle down and get the rest that
he so desperately needs. Poor P spent much of last night and most of today
tossing and turning, rolling this way and that, standing up and flopping down.
Unfortunately all this movement and agitation often causes his lines to get
tangled and his sensors and IVs to get tugged, causing him even more pain.
Because Persy was so agitated, someone had to essentially stand over him and
attend to him constantly to keep him safe. This causes Brittany and Ryan so
much stress and anxiety seeing their baby so inconsolable and upset. They are
exhausted emotionally and physically but not too tired to keep fighting and
advocating for their boy. I am so proud and amazed by their strength every day.

Persy was finally able to settle down this afternoon during a visit with the
music therapist who stayed at his bedside for over an hour. She played the
sweetest lil tunes that calmed our precious boy and allowed not only him to
relax but Ryan and Brittany too. The only other thing that calmed Persy besides
this was some videos on Britt’s phone of his bubba, Kep and his best good bud,
Myles.

Persy had to be sedated again today for his MIBG scan, a special nuclear
medicine scan used to detect the presence of neuroblastoma not revealed by the
MRI or CT.  Brittany was able to hold her boy and be with him as they lulled
Persy to sleep. We are praying that Persy is “avid” and responds to the test as
this would make him eligible for participation in a special MIBG treatment.
More on this later…

Lastly, while he was sedated, Persy had a nasogastric tube (NGT) placed, a
small tube that is inserted through his nose and travels to his tummy. Persy is
able to get his medicine and nutrition through this tube when he is not up to
taking food/drink by mouth, which may become even more of an issue as he
continues his chemo treatments.

### Little victories

- Persy made it through his second chemo treatment and is on his way to a full
  recovery!!
- Persy’s swelling went down today and the nurses reported that he put out more
  fluid than he took in!
- Persy’s NGT will give him more freedom to eat or not eat depending on how
  he's feeling.
- Persy allowed Brittany to hold and cuddle him as he was sedated for his scan.
- Persy pooped a little more today.
- Even though Persy is agitated, he is showing us he is a fighter and still has
  his spunk!

### Please pray

- For his agitation to decrease and for Persy to be more comfortable.
- For Persy’s swelling to continue to go down. This is especially crucial given
  that he’s now getting chemo.
- For his body to respond to the chemo and specifically that the chemo
  obliterates all the metastatic cancer sites in his body.
- For his cancer to be attacked by the chemo, but for his precious body to be
  protected from the damage caused by the toxic chemicals.

God our Refuge, we intercede for our sweet Persy and his family who are going
through this treatment for cancer. Lord, may You cover them with a blanket of
peace. May Persy, Britt and Ryan rest in confidence that You are sovereign over
this situation. Even though their life has been turned upside down and
unsettling things are happening, remind them that You hold Persy in your loving
arms. Let them know You love him and are caring for him throughout this
journey. Amen.
