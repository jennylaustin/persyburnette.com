First, thank you to everyone who is doing something to support our son Persy.
If you took some action like creating an account on a website or responding
with a comment or donation, our hearts are warmed and overwhelmed by all your
actions.

With that said, we're consolidating his our web presence here on this website,
[Prayers for Persy](https://persyburnette.org), located at
https://persyburnette.org. We think it's important for that to be something we
have final control of so we don't have to vet or interact with other
organizations.

### Use this website in lieu of others

Thank you if you interacted with the Caring Bridge page. Thank you to Andrew
Card for creating that for us. Please don't donate there. If you clicked the
link at that page you were donating to Caring Bridge, not directly to helping
Persy.

### Help us share this website

Please help us spread the word that this website is the home on the web for
this treatment.

### Give us time to request financial support in the best way

Thank you to everyone who created the GoFundMe or donated, but we have shut
that down. We're in the process of trying to refund those donations.

There will come a time when we give you a way to donate if we need it.

All the gifts are so touching to us. They are helpful and so greatly appreciated.
