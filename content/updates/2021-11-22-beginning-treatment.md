Things have progressed very quickly since coming to the hospital. It’s
unbelievable to see our smiling, happy, seemingly healthy boy be so sick. Our
precious boy has had a very rough couple of days. Persy has had a lot of pain
because of the cancer itself but he has also been extremely uncomfortable due
to a lot of swelling all over his body and being severely constipated.
Yesterday Persy had a biopsy of his bone marrow and primary tumor, which
confirmed that his cancer is neuroblastoma. He was also able to have his PICC
line removed which had been causing Brittany and Ryan a lot of worry whenever
he moved about. It was finally replaced by a port which is how he will receive
his medications from now on.

Today, Brittany and Ryan met with the neuroblastoma specialist at Wolfson’s for
several hours during which she explained his treatment plan from beginning to
end. They were able to have all of their questions answered and feel empowered
that they will beat this. They were told that Persy would begin his first cycle
of chemo later this evening.

### Little victories

- Persy made it through his first chemo treatment and is on his way to a full
  recovery!!
- Persy finally had a successful POOP and for the first time in a long time
  said “no” when asked if his tummy hurt!!!!!
- Persy ate an applesauce pouch and drank milk!!
- Brittany let us know that Persy acted a bit more like himself and “it was a
  blessing to see a glimpse of ‘our’ little boy again.”

### Please pray

- For Persy’s swelling to continue to go down. This is especially crucial given
  that he’s now getting chemo.
- For his body to respond to the chemo and specifically that the chemo
  obliterates all the metastatic cancer sites in his body.
- For his cancer to be attacked by the chemo, but for his precious body to be
  protected from the damage caused by the toxic chemicals.
